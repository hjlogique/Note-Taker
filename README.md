  ## Installation
  
  In command line type the `npm i` command to install the NPM package dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. It is [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), which is a flexible Node. js web app framework used to structure a web application to handle multiple different http requests at a specific url. Next type `node server.js` in the command line to run the server. The PORT number used for this application is 3001. To display the application use “localhost:3001” as the URL. This application is also running on the Heroku server. You can access it at this [link to Note Taker](https://glacial-wildwood-15051.herokuapp.com).
  
  ## Usage 
  
  Using this application, users can write view, save and delete notes. By clicking on the pen icon (new note button) users can create a new note. Once the note title and text content are entered, users can use the floppy disk icon (save button) to save the new note. Once the note is saved, a new row is added to the left column list. By clicking on the items in this list users can view the content of the note. The trash icon (delete button) in the listed items deletes the note and removes it from the list.
